## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture

```
App.jsx
  └─ SyncProvider (Context)
      ├─ Manages auth state globally
      ├─ Handles sync operations
      ├─ Tracks conflicts
      └─ Provides sync methods to all components

Components that use sync:
  ├─ ManagementScreen (login button)
  ├─ BottomTabNavigation (sync indicator)
  ├─ SyncConflictResolver (auto-triggered)
  ├─ SyncOnboardingPrompt (smart timing)
  └─ AuthScreen (login/register)
```

### Key Files

**New Context:**
- `src/contexts/SyncContext.jsx` - Global sync state management

**New Components:**
- `src/components/SyncStatusIndicator.jsx` - Compact sync status
- `src/components/SyncOnboardingPrompt.jsx` - Smart onboarding
- `src/components/AuthScreen.jsx` - Login/register (already existed)
- `src/components/SyncConflictResolver.jsx` - Conflict resolution (already existed)

**Updated Files:**
- `src/App.jsx` - Wrapped in SyncProvider, added global sync UI
- `src/components/ManagementScreen.jsx` - Uses SyncContext for auth
- `src/components/BottomTabNavigation.jsx` - Added sync indicator

**Utilities:**
- `src/lib/supabase.js` - Supabase client
- `src/lib/syncUtils.js` - Sync operations
- `src/hooks/useSync.js` - Sync hook (deprecated, use SyncContext)

### Sync Triggers

**Automatic Sync:**
1. ✅ On app startup (if logged in)
2. ✅ On login/signup
3. ✅ On auth state change

**Manual Sync:**
4. 👆 Click sync indicator in nav bar
5. 👆 Click "同步" in sync test panel

**Conflict Detection:**
- Compares `version` field (optimistic locking)
- Compares `updated_at` timestamps
- Checks `device_id` to identify source device

## 👥 User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Device User (No Login)

```
✅ Full app functionality offline
✅ Data saved to localStorage
✅ No sync prompt if <3 restaurants
⚠️ Data NOT backed up (local only)
💡 Can enable sync anytime from Management screen
```

### Scenario 2: Single Device User (With Login)

```
✅ All features of local mode
✅ Cloud backup of data
✅ Auto-sync on startup
✅ Can access from any device
💡 Great for peace of mind (data won't be lost)
```

### Scenario 3: Multi-Device User

```
✅ Add restaurant on phone → Appears on laptop
✅ Edit nutrition goal on laptop → Updates on phone
✅ Works offline, syncs when online
⚠️ Conflicts handled gracefully with UI
💡 Perfect for power users who use multiple devices
```

### Scenario 4: Shared Account (Not Recommended)

```
⚠️ Multiple people using same account
⚠️ May see each other's restaurants
⚠️ Frequent conflicts likely
💡 Better: Each person creates their own account
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Enable sync early** if you use multiple devices
2. **Don't share accounts** - create separate accounts for family members
3. **Resolve conflicts promptly** - don't let them accumulate
4. **Check sync status** - green cloud = you're backed up
5. **Use strong passwords** - at least 8 characters

### For Developers

1. **Test conflicts** - simulate offline edits on multiple devices
2. **Monitor sync failures** - check Supabase logs
3. **Optimize sync frequency** - balance UX vs. API calls
4. **Handle edge cases** - network errors, token expiry, etc.
5. **Provide clear feedback** - users should always know sync status

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

### Row Level Security (RLS)

- ✅ Users can only see their own data
- ✅ Enforced at database level (not just app level)
- ✅ Even Supabase admins can't see your restaurants without explicit policy

### Data Privacy

- 📍 **Local Mode**: Data never leaves your device
- ☁️ **Sync Mode**: Data encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- 🔒 **At Rest**: Supabase uses industry-standard encryption
- 🚫 **No Tracking**: No analytics, no third-party trackers

### Authentication

- 🔑 Passwords hashed with bcrypt (Supabase default)
- 🎫 JWT tokens for session management
- ⏰ Auto token refresh (no manual re-login needed)
- 🚪 Logout clears all local session data

---

## 📊 Analytics & Monitoring

### User-Facing Stats (Future Enhancement)

Could add to Management screen:
- Total restaurants: X
- Last synced: Y minutes ago
- Sync success rate: Z%
- Devices registered: N

### Admin Stats (Supabase Dashboard)

Available now:
- Total users
- Active sessions
- Sync operations per day
- Conflict resolution rate
- Error logs

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Not syncing" Issue

**Symptoms:** Green cloud icon but data not syncing

**Solutions:**
1. Click sync indicator to force manual sync
2. Check network connection
3. Logout and login again
4. Check Supabase Dashboard for errors

### "Frequent conflicts" Issue

**Symptoms:** Conflict resolver appears often

**Causes:**
- Using same account on multiple devices simultaneously
- Poor network causing partial syncs
- Offline edits not syncing properly

**Solutions:**
- Sync before making edits
- Resolve conflicts immediately
- Use manual sync after offline work
- Check device time settings (must be accurate)

### "Login not working" Issue

**Symptoms:** Can't register or login

**Solutions:**
1. Check email format is valid
2. Password must be 6+ characters
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify Supabase URL and key in `.env`
5. Check Supabase Dashboard → Authentication is enabled
