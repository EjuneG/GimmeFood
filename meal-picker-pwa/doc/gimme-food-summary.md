# Gimme Food PWA - Project Summary

## App Concept

**Problem Statement:**
Decision fatigue around meal choices drains mental energy throughout the day. Users struggle with what to eat for each meal, and this concern can even affect motivation to wake up in the morning.

**Solution:**
A Progressive Web App (PWA) that eliminates meal decision fatigue by allowing users to pre-configure meal options and use an algorithmic "Gimme Food!" button for instant meal selection.

## Core Features

### 1. Meal Management
- Users can set up their preferred meal options
- Options include delivery services, restaurants, and self-prepared meals
- Easy add/edit/remove functionality for meal options
- Categorization by meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks)

### 2. Smart Selection Algorithm
- **Manual Selection**: Browse and choose from configured options
- **"Gimme Food!" Button**: Algorithm automatically selects a meal based on:
  - User preferences
  - Time of day
  - Previous selections (to avoid repetition)
  - Any dietary restrictions or filters

### 3. User Experience
- Clean, intuitive interface
- Instant decision-making capability
- Offline functionality
- Installable as a mobile/desktop app

## Technical Infrastructure

### Frontend Framework
- **React** (v18+)
  - Component-based architecture
  - Modern hooks-based development
  - Excellent PWA support

### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS v4**
  - Utility-first CSS framework
  - Responsive design out-of-the-box
  - Easy customization and theming

### PWA Capabilities
- **Vite + vite-plugin-pwa**
  - Service worker for offline functionality
  - Web app manifest for installability
  - Automatic caching strategies
  - Background sync capabilities

### Data Storage
- **Local Storage / IndexedDB**
  - No backend required
  - Data persists locally on user's device
  - Privacy-focused (data never leaves device)
  - Offline-first architecture

### Development Environment
- **Node.js** with npm
- **WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for development
- **Vite** as build tool and dev server

## Architecture Benefits

### Cost Structure
- **100% Free Infrastructure**
  - No backend services required
  - No database hosting costs
  - Free deployment options (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)

### Performance
- Fast loading times (local data)
- Instant responses (no network calls for core functionality)
- Offline-capable
- Progressive enhancement

### Privacy & Security
- All data stored locally
- No user tracking
- No data transmission to external servers
- GDPR compliant by design

### Scalability
- No server infrastructure to maintain
- Scales with device storage
- No concurrent user limits
- No bandwidth costs

## Current Development Status

### Completed Setup
- [x] Node.js and npm environment configured
- [x] React app created with Vite
- [x] Tailwind CSS v4 integrated and tested
- [x] PWA plugin installed and configured
- [x] Development server running successfully
- [x] Basic responsive layout tested

### Development Environment Details
- **Project Location**: `~/GimmeFood/meal-picker-pwa`
- **Dev Server**: `http://localhost:5173/`
- **Build Tool**: Vite with Rolldown bundler
- **PWA Manifest**: Configured for "Gimme Food - Meal Picker"

### Next Implementation Phase
Ready for detailed requirement gathering and feature development:
1. Meal option management interface
2. "Gimme Food!" algorithm implementation
3. Local storage data persistence
4. Advanced filtering and preferences
5. Usage analytics (local only)
6. PWA optimization and icon creation

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- Local development with hot reload
- PWA testing in development mode
- Browser dev tools for debugging

### Production
- Static site deployment (Netlify/Vercel)
- Service worker for offline caching
- App store submission not required (PWA)
- Direct browser installation capability

## Technical Considerations

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with PWA support
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Data Management
- JSON-based data structure for meal options
- Local storage for simple preferences
- IndexedDB for complex meal history and analytics
- Data export/import functionality for backup

### Algorithm Considerations
- Weighted random selection
- Avoid recent repeats
- Time-based filtering (breakfast vs dinner options)
- User preference learning over time
